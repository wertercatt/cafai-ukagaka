CaFAI (Cool as Fuck Artificial Intelligence)

Created by Wertercatt (personalcatt.tumblr.com)

CaFAI is designed to play various games and do random tasks. He also looks after a planet called LoCAL, which is represented as his small circular sidekick which he sometimes gives commands to.

CaFAI makes use of the exec.dll plugin by Ryu (https://web.archive.org/web/20070210195709/http://www10.plala.or.jp:80/sryu/nanika/saori/)

This allows him to open games and other programs randomly. If you would like to disable this feature, simply click the "*Refuse to give perms" option in his bootup. You can also enable or disable it from his options menu if you change your mind while using him.

He also uses filetransfer.dll by Azura Levidre (https://levidre.github.io/my-saori) 

This lets him get TCG information from Scryfall and other sources, so he can tell you about Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and other cards.

He hails from the SBARGv2 roleplay setting, feel free to check out our forums at https://letssosl.boards.net/
